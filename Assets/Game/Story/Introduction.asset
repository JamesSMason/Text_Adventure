    you to fight a creature of some sort. An option to flee may be given, but if
    not \u2014 or if you choose to attack the creature anyway \u2014 you must resolve
    the battle as described below.\n\nFirst record the creature's SKILL and STAMINA
    scores in the first vacant Monster Encounter Bor on your Adventure Sheet. The
    scores for each creature are given in the book each time you have an encounter.\n\nThe
    sequence of combat is then:\n\n\t1. Roll the two dice once for the creature.
    Add its SKILL score. This total is the creature's Attack Strength.\n\t2. Roll
    the two dice once for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current SKILL score.
    This total is your Attack Strength.\n\t3. If your Attack Strength is higher than
    that of the creature, you have wounded it. Proceed to step 4. If the creature's
    Attack Strength is higher than yours, it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5,
    If both Attack Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other's blows
    \u2014 start the next Attack Round from step above.\n\t4. You have wounded the
    creature, so subtract 2 points from its STAMINA score. You may use your LUCK
    here to do additional damage (see over).\n\t5. The creature has wounded you,
    so subtract 2 points from your own STAMINA score. Again you may use LUCK at this
    stage (see over).\n\t6. Make the appropriate adjustments to either the creature's
    or your own STAMINA scores (and your LUCK score if you used LUCK \u2014 see over)\n\t7.
    Begin the next Attack Round (repeat steps 1\u20146). This sequence continues
    until the STAMINA score of either you or the creature you are fighting has been
    reduced to zero (death)."

    For reasons that will be explained below, SKILL, STAMINA
    and LUCK scores change constantly during an adventure. You must keep an accurate

    in the boxes or to keep an eraser handy. But never rub out your Initial scores.
    Although you may be awarded additional SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK points, these
    totals may never exceed your Initial scores, except on very rare occasions, when
    you will be instructed on a particular page.


    Your SKILL score reflects
    your swordsmanship and general fighting expertise; the higher the better. Your
    STAMINA score reflects your general constitution, your will to survive, your
    determination and overall fitness; the higher your STAMINA score, the longer
    you will be able to survive. Your LUCK score indicates how naturally lucky a
    person you are. Luck and magic are facts of life in the fantasy kingdom you are

  storyText: 'Luck


    At various times during your adventure, either in battles
    or when you come across situations in which you could either be lucky or unlucky
    (details of these are given on the pages themselves), you may call on your luck
    to make the outcome more favourable, But beware! Using luck is a risky business
    and if you are unlucky, the results could be disastrous.


    The procedure
    for using your luck is as follows: roll two dice. If the number rolled is equal
    to or less than  your current LUCK score, you have been lucky and the result
    will go in your favour. If the number rolled is higher than your current LUCK
    score, you have been unlucky and you will be penalized.


    This procedure
    is known as Testing Your Luck. Each time you ''Test Your Luck'', you must subtract
    one point from your current LUCK score. Thus you will soon realize that the more
    you rely on your luck, the more risky this will become.


    Using Luck in Battles


    On
    certain pages of the book you will be told to Test Your Luck and will be told
    the consequences of vour being lucky or unlucky. However, in battles, vou always
    have the option of using your luck either to inflict a more serious wound on
    a creature you have just wounded, or to minimize the effects of a wound the creature
    has just inflicted on you.


    If you have just wounded the creature, you may
    Test Your Luck as described above. If you are lucky, you have inflicted a severe
    wound and may subtract an extra 2 points from the creature''s STAMINA score.
    However, if you are unlucky, the wound was a mere graze and you must restore
    1 point to the creature''s STAMINA (i.e. instead of scoring the normal 2 points
    of damage, you have now scored only 1).


    If the creature has just wounded
    you, you may Test Your Luck to trv to minimize the wound. If you are lucky, you
    have managed to avoid the full damage of the blow, Restore 1 point of STAMINA
    (i.e. instead of doing 2 points of damage it has done only 1). If you are unlucky,
    you have taken a more serious blow. Subtract 1 extra STAMINA point.


    Remember
    that you must subtract 1 point from your own LUCK score each time you Test Your
    Luck.'

    Skill


    Your SKILL score
    will not change much during your adventure. Occasionally, a page may give instructions
    to increase or decrease your SKILL score. A Magic Weapon may increase your SKILL,
    but remember that only one weapon can be used at a time! You cannot claim 2 SKILL
    bonuses for carrying two Magic Swords. Your SKILL score can never exceed its
    Initial value unless specifically instructed. Drinking the Potion of Skill (see
    later) will restore your SKILL to its Initial level at any time.


    Stamina
    and Provisions


    Your STAMINA score will change a lot during your adventure
    as you fight monsters and undertake arduous tasks. As you near your goal, your
    STAMINA level may be dangerouslv low and battles may be particularly risky, so
    be careful!


    Your haversack contains enough Provisions for ten meals. You
    may rest and eat only when allowed by the instructions on a page, and you may
    eat only one meal at a time. Eating a meal restores 4 STAMINA points. When you
    eat a meal, add 4 points to your STAMINA score and deduct 1 point from your Provisions.
    A separate Provisions Remaining box is provided on the Adventure Sheet for recording
    details of Provisions. Remember that you have a long way to go, so use your Provisions
    wisely!


    Remember also that your STAMINA score may never exceed its Initial
    value unless specifically instructed on a page. Drinking the Potion of Strength
    (see later) will restore your STAMINA to its Initial level at any time.


    Luck


    Additions
    to your LUCK score are awarded through the adventure when you have been particularly
    lucky. Details are given on the pages of the book. Remember that, as with SKILL
    and STAMINA, your LUCK score may never exceed its Initial value unless specifically
    instructed on a page. Drinking the Potion of Fortune (see later) will restore
    your LUCK to its Initial level at any time, and increase your Initial LUCK by
    point.'
